# Every day procedures

These procedures are used every day.


## Starting the development server

```bash
[esantanche@luna sapperapp]$ npm run dev
```

## Connecting to the container

(Eventually I didn't use Docker)

This opens a bash shell in the container.

```bash
sudo docker exec -i -t CppDevWebsite bash
```
