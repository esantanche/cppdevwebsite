# Every day procedures

These procedures are used every day.

## Connecting to the container

(Eventually I didn't use Docker)

This opens a bash shell in the container.

```bash
sudo docker exec -i -t CppDevWebsite bash
```

## Starting the development server


FIXME 

```bash
[esantanche@luna sapperapp]$ npm run dev
```
